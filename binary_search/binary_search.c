 * @brief An implementation of the binary search algorithm. Due to the nature of the algorithm, there is actually
 *        multiple approaches to implementing the algorithm. It's simplicity allows for the algorithm to be
 *        to be implemented following an iterative method, but its repetitive sectioning suggests a potential for 
 *        a recursive implementation.
 *        The algorithm is to be implemented in C so that I may further practice using the programming language.
