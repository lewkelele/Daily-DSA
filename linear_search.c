/* 
 * In order to manifest and develop a passion for algorithms and the logic behind them, I have 
 * decided to try to study an algorithm every day. The algorithms will be implemeneted in an
 * arbitrary langauge, with likely aribitrary libraries, given that I am to provide a reason 
 * for its usage. This is largely so that I am forced to develop a deeper understanding of the 
 * tools that I use. The first algorithm in this collection will be the implementation of a 
 * simple algorithm: Linear Search.
 *
 * Linear Search is likely the easiest algorithm to implement while also one of the most efficient 
 * given that the input size is reasonably small. The algorithm traverses through each individual
 * element in a data set until the desired element has been identified.
 *
 * The algorithm was implemented in C due to how both the programming language and algorithm
 * parallel one another in basic concept. Both are very simple. It just felt fitting.
